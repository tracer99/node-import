This is a sample project.

I'm trying to replicate an issue where unit tests are not importing node modules from the node_modules directory using steal, but instead from /

To more closely replicate this issue, the root of the site is in htdocts/static

No webserver component lives in our project so point nginx or apache at that dir

If you go to / the page loads with "Hello World".
If you go to ucp2/dashboard/test.html you get a bunch of errors that imports are failing
